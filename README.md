Welcome to Temperature Conversion, a simple web application that I created as part of the Bharat Internship program. This application allows you to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Rankine. With just a few clicks, you can quickly and easily convert temperatures and get accurate results in different temperature scales.

This application uses a JavaScript function that takes the temperature in Celsius as input and calculates the equivalent values in Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Rankine. The formula for the conversion is straightforward, making it easy to understand how the application works.

Whether you are a student, a scientist, or just someone who wants to convert temperatures, this application is a useful tool that can make your life easier. As part of my Bharat Internship program, I had the opportunity to create this application and enhance my programming skills. So, go ahead and try it out!
